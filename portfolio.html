                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Queen Mary University with a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering back in 2019. In all honesty I didn't really enjoy this degree because I found it quite boring at times. I liked studying and learning about the theory but the non stop report writing felt draining. I knew that once I graduated i didn't want pursue a career in this field. IT is more practical and I feel that this is more engaging and enjoyable and that is why I became interested tech. I enrolled into a bootcamp called Pivot2Tech into the Software Engineering course in hope of getting the neccessary knowledge that will allow me to take a step closer in landing a role in tech.
